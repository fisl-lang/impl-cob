# Cobol Implementation

This is a implementation of the FISL compiler and virtual machine in Cobol under tk4- mvs 3.8j. 
It includes a Cobol source library, JCL library and FISL program library, 
which are all contained in a directory of the respective dataset to contain them.
The implementation has to run with the exact provided dataset names, as they are hard-coded into some of the JCL.
